Time Conversion Project
This project is a Java-based application developed in NetBeans, which converts time between different time zones using an external API. The application also integrates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve conversion history and relevant data.

Features
Convert time between different time zones.
Retrieve time conversion data via an external API.
Store conversion history in a MySQL database.
View previously converted times from the database.
Technologies Used
Java: Core logic and development.
NetBeans: IDE used for developing the project.
MySQL: Used as a database to store conversion history and user data.
API: A third-party API is used to fetch and convert time across different time zones.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Java (version 8 or higher)
NetBeans IDE
MySQL (version 5.7 or higher)
Maven (for managing dependencies)
Database Setup
Install and configure MySQL.

Create a new database for this project using the following command:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE time_conversion_db;
Inside the time_conversion_db database, create the necessary tables using the following SQL queries:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE conversion_history (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  original_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  converted_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  from_timezone VARCHAR(50),
  to_timezone VARCHAR(50),
  conversion_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Update the MySQL configuration in the Java project to connect to your MySQL instance. This typically involves configuring the connection URL, username, and password in the project properties or the code:

java
Copy code
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/time_conversion_db";
String user = "root";
String password = "your_password";
API Integration
This project uses an external API for time conversion. You can select any API that provides time zone conversion services (for example, TimeZoneDB or WorldTimeAPI).

Register and get your API key.
Update the API key in your Java project.
For example:

java
Copy code
String apiKey = "your_api_key";
String apiUrl = "https://api.timezonedb.com/v2.1/convert-time-zone";
Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

TimeConversionService.java: Contains logic for converting time using the external API.
DatabaseManager.java: Manages the connection to the MySQL database and handles storing/retrieving data.
Main.java: The entry point of the application, providing a simple CLI for user interaction.
APIClient.java: Handles API requests and responses for time conversion.
GUI (Optional): If you have built a graphical user interface, this module will handle user inputs and display conversion results.
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https:https://github.com/sanjay-ramesh94/TIme_conversion.git
Open the project in NetBeans.

Set up your MySQL database as described above.

Configure the API integration by adding your API key to the appropriate section in APIClient.java.

Build and run the project using NetBeans.

Usage
Input a time and the source time zone.
Select the destination time zone for conversion.
View the converted time.
Check the conversion history stored in the MySQL database.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies configured in your pom.xml or manually added to the classpath:

JDBC Driver for MySQL:

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
  <groupId>mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.23</version>
</dependency>
HTTP Client (if not using Java's built-in HTTP classes):

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
  <version>4.5.13</version>
</dependency>
Future Improvements
Implement a GUI for a more user-friendly interface.
Add user authentication and authorization for secured access to conversion history.
Improve error handling and logging.
